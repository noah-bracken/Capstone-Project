# Capstone-Project
A mobile/web application for easier attendance management. When completed it will allow teachers/faculty to display a QR code which can be scanned by students to mark their attendance. In the application teachers would be able to see each individual date and its attendance as well as an overview of the overall course attendance for each student.
