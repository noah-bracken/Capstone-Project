export const preamble = `By accessing, initiating, installing, downloading, whispering about, or otherwise engaging with the NOMark Application ("NOMark", "the Platform", "this glorious beacon of order"), the User ("You") agrees to be bound — legally, ethically, cosmically — to the entirety of this Agreement. These Terms and Conditions govern your use of all services offered by NOMark, including attendance verification, QR scanning, reminder distribution, and other mysterious future features yet to be disclosed by the Council of Developers.

If you disagree with any clause, subclause, or decorative paragraph border, you must cease using NOMark immediately and forget it ever existed (preferably through a court-appointed memory erasure agent, if available in your district).

This Agreement is binding in all known and unknown dimensions and supersedes all previous oaths, contracts, and spit-handshakes relating to digital attendance.`;
